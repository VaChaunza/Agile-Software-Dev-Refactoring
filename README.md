# Agile Software Development: Refactoring
Refactoring for high-performance Agile Software Development. Refactoring for better code. Refactoring is about improving the quality of your code by simplifying your code. Simpler code enables agility, the ability to change your code quickly, to add new features, to meet people's ever changing needs.

I am using a test-driven development methodology & techniques here for a full understanding of what is it all about? And why is it important?
Please read this article [Test-Driven Development: Really, It's a Design Technique](https://www.infoq.com/articles/test-driven-design-java/).

## How it works? ü§î
Each article is divided into steps, and in each step, I have managed to have a git commit for each TDD red-green-blue change. So, when navigating commits, we can notice the differences, and the refactoring is done toward final Kata requirements.
